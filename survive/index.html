            <p>
                A bit of shameless promotion, but if you do in fact enjoy this mod and would like to support me, please purchase my game <a href = https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/carnage-chase-8445af>Carnage Chase</a> or join my <a href = https://patreon.com/stereowalker>Patreon</a>, preferably on the lowest tier.
                Though I would prefer you get the game, if you could do both, I would highly appreciate it. You'd be helping me with rent and keeping the lights on

            <h1>DATA PACKS</h1>
            <span>
                <p>
                    This mod gets a lot of its operational data from datapacks. Before we start the tutorial, there are some things we need to cover. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <tab1>1), 
                    <code class="language-plaintext"> [mod_id]:[item_name]</code> 
                    refers to the item you want to edit. When using the 
                    <code class="language-plaintext"> /give</code> 
                    command, the first words before
                    <code class="language-plaintext"> :</code> 
                    refer to the 
                    <code class="language-plaintext"> [mod_id]</code> 
                    while the parts after it refer to the 
                    <code class="language-plaintext"> [item_name]</code>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <tab1>2), All files will be stored in 
                    <code class="plaintext">data/[mod_id]/survive_modifiers/...</code>
                    . Keep that in mind when arranging your files as the mod won't read your file if you don't put it in the correct location
                </p>
                <p>
                    <tab1>3), I will not be teaching you how to make a datapack, you'll have to learn that elsewhere. I'll just continue under the asumption that you know the bare minimum of how they work.
                </p>
                <p>Now that we've covered that, here's what you can modify</P>
            </span>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Armor data</h2>
                    <p><tab1>There are 2 things that can be modified here, one thing being more complicated than the other and that is weight and temperature.</p>
                    <p>Here is a sample of the file. It's files are stored in <code class="plaintext">.../armors/[item_name].json</code></p>
                    
                    <div class="parent_cb"><pre><code class="json child_cb dynamic_file" id="armor_example.json"></code></pre></div>
                
                    <p><tab1>I'll start with the less complicated one. The second field, <code class="json">"weight_modifier": 4.37</code> gives you control of the percieved weight of the armor peice. 
                    The unit of measure is kg so if you naitively use pounds or anything else, convert your value to kilograms and input it here</p>
                    <p>For the complicated part, we have <code class="json">"temperature_modifiers": {}</code>. This gives you control of how that armor peice will interact with the players temperature. Here, 
                    you'll provide a list of conditions and the mod checks them and applies whatever is there in ascending order. In the above example, I provided 2 conditions 
                    <code class="json">"condition": "survive:on_fire"</code>
                    and
                    <code class="json">"condition": "survive:default"</code>
                    . The first one applies it's temperature value when the player is on fire making the player a lot hotter while the second will always set the players temperature relatively hot.
                    If I had used the second one first, the first one will never trigger as the second one is always active. As for what these conditions are, 
                    </p>

                        <code class="json">"survive:winter_begin": -0.6</code> makes the begining of every winter relatively cold. Setting this to a positive value will instead make your winters hot.

                        <tab1> There are 3 things that can be modified in your file
                    </p>
                    <p>1) <code class="plaintext">"temperature_modifier"</code></p>
                    <p>
                        <tab1>This controls how hot or cold the block should be to the player. Setting this to a negative value will make the block cold while a positive value will make it hot. Adjust this to your liking

                    <p>2) <code class="plaintext">"range"</code></p>
                    <p>
                        <tab1>This controls how close the player needs to be to the block for it to affect them. The range is measured in blocks
                    </p>
                    <p>2) <code class="plaintext">"blockstate_property_overrides"</code></p>
                    <p>
                        <tab1>This will override <code class="plaintext">"temperature_modifier"</code> if the blockstate meets the requirements you put in here. It's a bit complicated, but I'll guide you through how this works. 
                            First is the <code class="plaintext">"name"</code>, you need this to match the property you're trying to use. Our
                            example is targeting snow, so <code class="plaintext">"layers"</code> is appropriate. Next is the <code class="plaintext">"type"</code> of property and there are 
                            3 valid types: <code class="plaintext">"integer"</code> (numbers), <code class="plaintext">"enum"</code> (text), and <code class="plaintext">"boolean"</code> (true/false). Next are <code class="plaintext">"min"</code> and <code class="plaintext">"max"</code>,
                            They're only used if you have your <code class="plaintext">"type"</code> set to <code class="plaintext">"integer"</code>. These are the minimum and maximum possible values of that state and if they don't match what the game sees as
                            the maximum and minimum, this override will fail. I've used 1 as the minimum and 8 as the maximum as those are the values for snow. You can use a <a href ="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Debug_Stick">debug stick</a> to check the values. 
                            Lastly, we have <code class="plaintext">"values"</code> where you map every value of that state that you want to affect the player to a temperature. In our example, I've omited "1" as I would prefer it use the devault value for temperature.
